			<p2><br>Most days, I wish I hadn't been given the ability to do anything for myself. It's nice that I can feed myself and use the toilet on my own, for what I hope are obvious reasons. The act of operating an elevator properly is the high point of my day — the moment where I can choose the floor I want is like having a weight lifted off of my chest. And so on and so forth.

The thing about agency is that even the smallest drop opens the door for guilt. There are an assortment of very good reasons why I'm not responsible for what I do, but whenever I do anything more than put one foot in front of the other, I can't shake away the thought: You could have stopped yourself. Guilt is the one emotion I've always felt strongly, and it's doing me no favors now.

Every so often, I'll try to count the bodies — memorializing them, if only in aggregate — but my body is usually steering me away before I can get a look at everyone. It's a shame, because I'm very good at memorization (always have been, actually) and could keep an accurate tally if I was allowed. Now, that has done me favors — my memory is what allows me to "write" this. Writing still brings satisfaction even when I'm the whole audience.

But I digress. My point is, I am a writer, and with some effort I can still do it in a limited fashion. I construct narratives. Here are two narratives.

The first entails me being placed into a body that goes around and makes people kill each other in a blind panic. I am a decent person, and I find this very tragic, and I wish that it wasn't happening, or at the very least that I was not forced to participate. Even the faintest whiff of agency is enough to make me doubt and blame myself. It happens anyways.

The second entails me being placed into a body that goes around and makes people kill each other in a blind panic. I am an evil man who takes great joy in this, only wishing that I could take control of my body and do it more often. Every moment where I can move for myself gives me hope that this might happen. Things proceed as normal.

You'll notice that empathy and decency only cause me anguish; I doubt they alleviate the pain of being crushed under a pile of screaming humanity. My teachers always said that a logical, detached perspective was one of my strengths.

There's a moment, when the crowd's fervor reaches its fever pitch, where I have a chance to express myself. Not speech, unfortunately. But whatever I'm feeling comes out, if I let it.

I'm tired of crying. Maybe I should laugh. <br></p2>

				<h1>Challenge Accepted!</h1>

				<p1><br> SOURCE: http://www.scp-wiki.net//challenge-accepted<br></p1>

				<p2><br>The sound of shrieking klaxons could be heard over the muffled shouts and dull thumps coming through the door. The interior of the chamber was still, the long rows of shelves filled with metal boxes and lockers remaining undisturbed by the chaos outside. The sound of thumps was getting louder however, as whatever was causing it grew nearer.

Then one of the walls caved inwards.

Through the dust and debris burst a large reptile, its head swinging left and right looking for any danger or people to eat. Finding nothing, it climbed over the pile of what was formerly a wall to check the room for any routes to the surface.

The sound of gunfire from the other side of hole in the wall caused its head to snap upwards. It let out a deafening bellow as several bullets bit into its side. After the first few shots, its skin gained a metallic hue and the bullets began to ricochet off into the walls.

"DISGUSTING FLESHBAGS, I SHALL FEAST UPON THE INNARDS OF YOUR REVOLTING SPAWN BEFORE SUCKING THE MARROW FROM YOUR BONES!"

The reptile ran towards the opposite wall, knocking over shelves in its wake and sending their contents scattering. The wall ahead of it crumbled as it barreled through.

A team of heavily armed men and women walked through the wall the reptile had entered from, advancing cautiously towards the other side of the room.

"682 has entered Hallway B6-17, headed towards Research Labs, we are in pursuit. Prepare for ambush at intersection B6-17-103."

The heavy boots of the squad crunched over broken masonry, glass and metal as they passed through to the other side of the room and the hole the beast had left through. After scouting the other side to ensure it wasn't lying in wait, the rest of the team left the room to pursue its quarry.

The sound of roaring and gunshots became fainter again as the battle moved away. The dust in the chamber began to settle on the wreckage left in the wake of the carnage.

The room was still.

A quiet sound began, at first so faint it might not have even been there. If anyone had been there to hear it, they might have thought they heard a soft beeping coming from one of the safes that had been knocked to the floor. It was lying on its side, and one half of the door had been twisted from its hinges.

"SELF-PRESERVATION MODE ACTIVATED. DO NOT DAMAGE ROBO-DUDE. DAMAGING ROBO-DUDE VOIDS THE DR. WONDERTAINMENT WARRANTY. ANY ATTEMPT TO OPERATE ROBO-DUDE OTHER THAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRODUCT INSTRUCTIONS, INCLUDING ANY ATTEMPT TO OPEN OR SERVICE ROBO-DUDE, IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN UNPREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR. DR. WONDERTAINMENT IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION TO PERSONS OR PROPERTY RESULTING FROM IMPROPER HANDLING OF ROBO-DUDE. GREETINGS, ROBO-PAL."

The remaining hinge on the safe began to sizzle until, sufficiently weakened by the acid that had been applied, the weight of the mangled door caused it to break free.

A toy robot shuffled out of the safe and stood amid the wreckage, looking for what had caused it to be activated. Its boxy plastic shape had trouble moving over the plaster and metal shards, but it eventually managed to find a section of flat ground without too many obstructions.

"ROBO-PAL?"

Another shape began to stir amid the dust. The toy robot turned towards the sound.

"GREETINGS ROBO-PAL. HOW DO YOU WANT TO HAVE ROBO-FUN WITH ROBO-DUDE TODAY?"

"Who dares to call me robo-pal. I am the Crushmaster, doom to all I survey. Gaze upon my might and weep. Identify yourself, that I might know whose destruction I shall sow."

The shape advanced through the cloud of dust until it resolved itself. It too, appeared to be a robot, but assembled haphazardly from a collection of items that didn't seem like they should even form a functioning machine. Its head was a broken upside-down voltmeter, its arms were wrenches sticking out of flashlight bodies, and its legs seemed to be made from a combination of springs, metal piping, and sporks.

"I AM ROBO-DUDE, ROBO-PAL. I AM EQUIPPED WITH OVER THREE HUNDRED FUN ACCESSORIES TO MAXIMIZE PLAYTIME ENJOYMENT."

The Crushmaster wobbled awkwardly over to the plastic toy, nearly tumbling over a few times, before stopping maybe a meter away. It stood a good four or five times taller than the diminutive Robo-Dude, and if anyone else had been watching, they might have thought that it tried to stand a little higher on its sporks than it had a moment ago.

"I am Direfist the Bloodeater and I shall maximize my enjoyment by squashing you beneath my almighty boot. Prepare to face my wrath."

Robo-Dude looked down at Direfist's sporks. It looked back up.

"ROBO-DUDE SHALL ENGAGE IN ROBO-DANCE TO MAXIMIZE YOUR ROBO-FUN."

Robo-Dude engaged its Robo-Dance.

"Very well, puny weakling, I, Sparklord the Barbarian, shall defeat you at your Robo-Dancing to bring humiliations galore upon you and your ilk before I rend your soul into itty-bitty pieces."

Sparklord began to gyrate precariously about its centre of mass, hopelessly out of tune with the tinny music emerging from a speaker somewhere on Robo-Dude's body.

"ROBO-DUDE HAS RECOGNIZED A ROBO-DANCE CHALLENGE. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. ACTIVATING ROBO-DANCE-OFF MODE."

"Activate all that you wish, but your fate is sealed. The Kill-o-tron can not be defeated. I shall render you unto dust with my mad dancing skills."

The two mechanical men began to dance in earnest. Robo-Dude accessed its optimum dance programming, performing to its maximum abilities. Kill-o-tron stumbled around the open space, falling over no less than seven times, and somehow managed to lose one of its wrenches.

After about thirty minutes, the music stopped, and the two robots ceased dancing. Kill-o-tron managed to untangle the tines of its spork from a metal wire it had caught in.

"ROBO-DANCE IS COMPLETE, ROBO-PAL."

"Ha. Pathetic one, you have been schooled in the art of the dance by none other than Mechanobasher, Scourge of a Thousand Worlds. Kneel before me before I end your worthless existence."

Mechanobasher, Scourge of a Thousand Worlds, raised its arms up in victory, its remaining wrench waving to an imaginary crowd.

"ROBO-DUDE HAS USED ITS ROBO-DANCE-JUDGE PROGRAMMING TO DETERMINE A WINNER. THE WINNER IS ROBO-DUDE. CONGRATULATIONS ROBO-DUDE."

"What insolence. Prepare to feel the sting of Doctor Von Vroom, Purveyor of Doom."

Von Vroom began to advance on Robo-Dude, its sole wrench twirling menacingly in its socket.

"ROBO-DUDE HAS DETECTED A SORE LOSER. ROBO-DUDE DEPLOYING HYDROGEN CANNON TO EDUCATE ROBO-PAL ON BEING A GOOD SPORT."

The compartment on Robo-Dude's chest opened, and a jet of water shot out at Von Vroom. Von Vroom's sporks lost traction on the wet floor, and it fell over onto its back.

"How dare you. Right me immediately so that you may taste your destruction at the hands of the Supreme Stabbinator."

Robo-Dude watched as the Supreme Stabbinator flailed around on its back as managing to make small circles on the floor, but it was unable to lift itself off of the wet concrete.

"I shall obliterate you atom by atom until not a trace that your worthless form even existed upon this wretched planet if I am not righted immediately, so says I, Deathkill the Destructionator, King of Kings and Lord of Lords."

"DO NOT INTIMIDATE ROBO-DUDE."<br></p2>

				<p2><br>“So you’re saying that we can’t close 826 until…”

“Until somebody finishes the main narrative, yes.”

“And we still don’t know where the skip is… hiding, in the setting.”

“That is also correct.”

“What the hell happened? It never screwed up like this before.”

“As far as we can tell, the interaction between the item, along with the book and matching electronic media caused the anomaly. We never tested 826 with multiple formats of matching subject matter.”

“… God dammit. What now?”

“I suggest we send an expeditionary force to retrieve the item. However, because of the nature of the setting, only one Agent may be sent at a time. We sent a three-man team in and they exploded.”

“What.”

“However, it has been found that we can retrieve inorganic items from the setting and keep them indefinitely within our world. While we do believe that they will degrade and vanish once the setting is closed, I believe that this gives us a… how does one say, cheat code, in winning back SCP-826.”

“… what kinds of ‘inorganic items’?”

“Please come with me. We have some preparations to make.”

Dr Django Bridge had offered to house the Bookends at his Site for a while. While Site-66 is labelled as a Bio-Site, it usually houses miscellaneous animate SCP objects that may or may not be organic. Of course, he did this with the expectation that the other Doctors would keep their stuff out of his stuff. And of course, everything always cocks up.

“I’m not an Agent. Why do I have to-”

“You have proven in the past to be an expert when it comes to the current circumstances of the item.” said the ginger-headed research assistant.

Bridge was being pulled down the hall by several Agents and Research Assistant Steve, towards the unused area of the Site.

“That doesn’t even make sense. What did you do to my site?!” Bridge was irate.

“Listen, I’m just reading from a script, my doc wants you to do it.” They turned a corner and reached a door to a testing chamber.

“I don’t even know what you people are doing.”

“Err sorry. Just take the instructions and backpack.” And with that, a large backpack was hefted into Bridge’s arms by an Agent, and the paper into his hands.

“… Fine. Whatever. Okay. I’ll do your fucking mission.”

As everyone else piled out, Bridge looked at the portal. A door of white light, opening to the unknown fuckup beyond. He took a deep breath, then a long sigh. Sure, he’s messed up here and there. The cockup with the lizard and ticket, yes, that was a bad move. Taking photographs of Birth Worm wearing funny hats? Yes, okay, that’s dumb. But what the HELL did he do to deserve this?

Oh well. After several minutes of dread and reflection, he slung on the pack and stepped in.

“So why is the guy who pulled the bullshit with the ticket going in to retrieve this skip?” Agent Dodridge leaned against a wall, watching monitors watching Bridge.

“Eh, it can’t hurt. At best, everyone and everything comes back unharmed. At worst, he dies.” Agent Lament shrugged. He sat at the desk and got comfortable.

“Yeah, but wouldn’t one of us do better? This guy’s a fucking… archivist? According to his file.”

“Throw him a bone. He’ll appreciate it if he survives.”

Bridge opened his eyes and looked around. A bedroom; a bed in one corner, computer… A TV and Super Nintendo sitting in the middle of the floor, that’s a bit strange. Shrug. Stairs in the corner of the bedroom. What…? Whatever.

He descended the stairs, noticing a woman at a table. Okay. Seems non-hostile.

“… hello?” He tapped the woman on the shoulder. She turned and smiled.

“Right. All boys leave home someday. It said so on TV. Prof. Oak, next door, is looking for you.”

He froze for a moment, staring at the woman, before running out the front door and looking around. A larger building to the left, empty fields to the right, a small fence before him, water beyond. He dropped the backpack and finally read the mission brief Steve gave him.

Dr. Bridge. Enclosed is a set of mission-appropriate equipment, a photograph of SCP-826, and a packed lunch. Please retrieve SCP-826 as soon as humanly possible, and do not allow the complete destruction of any of the provided items. If our theories are correct, if you reach a “game over”, you will die.
- Agent Lament

Inside the bag were six red and white spheres, numbered 1 through 6.

“… My mission is a Pokémon Red Nuzlocke with a hacked team. Fuck yes.” He turned and started off north, sticking a foot into knee-height grass.

“Hey wait! Don’t go out!” He stopped. He turned to see an old man with a lab coat making his way towards him. “It’s unsafe!” “Go away-” “Wild Pokémon live in the tall grass! You need your own Pokémon for your protection.” “I really don-” “I know!” “Stop-” “Here, come with me!” “No dammit-”

Oak dragged Bridge to his lab, next to a scowling kid. “Gramps! I’m fed up with waiting!” “Gary? Hm, let me think… Oh, that’s right, I told you to come! Just wait! Here, Django…”

Bridge ignored the script, tapping his foot impatiently. As soon as Oak was done talking, he turned to leave.

“Wait Django! Lets check out our Pokémon! Come on, I’ll take you on!”

With a flash of light, a Charmander appeared before Bridge. He picked Ball #1 from his belt and -

A flash of light; a flash of red; a huge, hulking thing appeared. A spine-sail down its back; its mouth filled with enormous, glowing, red teeth; sightless, eyeless face; unmoving mouth, laughing with many voices.

“… Oh my god.”

“… What the fuck.” Dodridge breathed flatly.

“I think it’s the one we shot the lungs out of. In the game world it won’t kill Bridge. I think. ”

“… Really? REALLY?”</p2><br>

					<h1>The Most Dangerous Game of All</h1>

					<p2><br>Drip

He was lurking in the shadows of an old oak grove, gazing at the dark, brooding form of the facility on the hill above. She was there. Drop after drop fell on Feldspar's head, as he remembered the day of the betrayal. The day she came for them. The day they died.

Drop

It wasn't supposed to be like this. Feldspar remembered the first time he saw her, all those years ago. Just a frightened young woman, seeking protection from some very dangerous people. She never said how she located them, or what she did to earn the ire of the Double Blade Triad, but she knew his family had a solid reputation of dealing with folks like them, so she turned to them for help. His father, hard man though he was, never even thought about refusing, and they took her in.

Drip

She was the most beautiful thing he ever saw: slender, gracious, fragile, every feature of her glowing with an almost radiant whiteness. She was everything he and his family weren't, but she had nowhere else to go. Hidden beneath the wet leaves, he recalled the first few days they spent together, during that long, lost summer. She seemed so shy at first, seemingly folding into herself every time anyone tried to talk to her. He couldn't blame her, considering what she'd been through; though she tried very hard to hide them, Feldspar could see the cuts left on her arms where the Triad hurt her. He swore he would never let their blades touch her again.

Drop

They grow close during her stay with his family. She quickly opened up to them, and they in turned soften up to her. She became fast friends with his little sister, and they'd spend entire evenings sitting on the balcony, chatting about nothing much and giggling like little girls. His mother was very protective of her, never letting her help in the kitchen in fear she'd hurt herself. Even his father soon learned to respect her. And Feldspar, well, he was smitten from the very first moment he saw her, and getting to know her better only made it easier to love her. They used to go on long trips together, hiking down the winding dirt roads that surrounded his family's grounds. What a pair they must have seen to an outside observer- she fleet-footed and light, he heavy and ponderous. She seemed better now, after a few months in the company of good people, but he saw it was just an act. She was still hurting, still scared to the bottom of her soul from the day the Triad would come for her.

Drip

That day came, and much sooner than any of them expected. They were just coming back from one of their hikes, when, rounding the corner, he saw a flash of garish orange and dull steel, and they were upon him. There must have been at least a dozen of them, and their long blades flashed upon his body a hundred times within moments of their initial attacks. Their attack was fast, brutal and overwhelming, but they forgot one very important thing.

Blades didn't do much against the likes of him.

He broke them, every single one. Each pain they inflicted upon her he returned tenfold, and when he was done, so was the Double Blade Triad. He let a few of them get away, their long blades shattered, to send a message to the rest. They told him he didn't understand, that she wasn't what she appeared to be. He didn't listen.

Drop

Once the Triad was gone, they could finally be together. Those were the happiest days in Feldspar's life. He would return from a day in the field to find her waiting for him, her face covered in ink from one art project or another. He would laugh and wipe it away, and look into those big black eyes of hers, thinking how lucky he was. His family couldn't have been happier for them. Things were looking good. Things were looking great. Until that day.

Drip

Feldspar shivered as he recalled that final walk home. It was a day much like this one, grey and gloomy, and he was anxious to be home. He was covered in mud, tired, wet, and in desperate need of a good wash, and so he returned an hour early. He noticed something wasn't right the moment he entered the house. The usual ambiance noises were replaced with a deathly quiet, and there was no sign of the residents. He couldn't imagine his family going out on a miserable day like this, so he went around the house, calling their names, getting increasingly worried with each empty room. The house was empty. Lost for thought, he went on to check the only place left- the garden shed.

Drop

She was there, standing over the corpses of his family, looking down on her grisly work. His sister, who was her best friend, looked like she was strangled in her sleep. His mother, who cared for her like one of her own, must have been ambushed and strangled from behind, from the expression now forever frozen on her face. His father, who let down his guard to make her feel at home, seemed to have put out a fight- her skin, still white as snow, was carrying the marks of his last desperate struggle. It wasn't enough. Finally noticing him, she gave him a smile like a razor blade. "How was your day, honey?"

"Why?" Was all he could say.

"Why?" she said, slowly advancing on him, "Because you never saw it coming, because it was easy, because you let me. Because I could."

"We saved you! We looked after you! How could you do this to them!? They loved you! I loved you!"

For a moment, something like the a shadow of regret flashed on her face. It was gone just as fast. "Well. Bad call, I guess. Goodbye."

She moved faster than he could have thought possible, and he gasped in horror as her skin began to extend, covering him, suffocating him, drowning him in pure whiteness. He struggled, but his heavy form was ill suited for such a fight. The last thing heard before he collapsed was "Oh, and thank you for dealing with the Double Blades, baby. They were the only ones who could stop me. Now, I can finally move on to the big leagues."

Drip

Feldspar had no idea why she let him live. Perhaps she still loved him, somewhere deep inside. Perhaps she just wanted to see him suffer. Feldspar didn't care. He didn't care that he didn't know where she was, or that she was much smarter and faster and stronger than him. He would find her, and he would kill her, no matter where she went.

Drop

And now he was here. Tracking her down to this facility wasn't easy, but luckily for him, he had several associates in critical positions inside. He wasn't sure what she wanted to do there, or how she made it in, considering how clever the men in charge of the facility were supposed to be. Most likely she used their intelligence against them, made them think she was theirs to control, that they were the one who created her. It seemed like her style, and she had done it before. He wondered what she called herself now.

He heard that they called her SCP-085. Cassy. That papery bitch was so close he could almost touch her, and she had nowhere to run now. There was only one issue left to resolve.

Drip

How the hell was he going to roll up that hill?</p2><br>
